# HTML-CSS---Table-with-Hover
A table with CSS hover effect changes the appearance of the table when the user hovers over a specific row or cell. This can be achieved using the ":hover" selector with other CSS properties like "background-color" and "color" and applied to specific rows, columns, or cells using CSS class or id selectors.
